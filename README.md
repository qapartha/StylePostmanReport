## 🔍 Overview

**API Report Studio** is a free, open-source web app built using **AI-assisted tools** and modern front-end frameworks. It allows QA Engineers, API Developers, and DevOps teams to **convert raw Postman/Newman-style JSON test results into a polished, stakeholder-friendly HTML or PDF report** — in seconds.

As a QA professional, I saw a gap in our tools: while we could run automated tests and collect results, there was no easy way to share those results in a clean, readable format — especially for **non-technical stakeholders**.

This app solves that problem.
